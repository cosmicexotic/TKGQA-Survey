# Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering: A Survey

Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) has been a long-standing field to answer questions based on Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Recently, the evolving nature of knowledge has attracted a growing interest in Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA), an emerging task to answer temporal questions based on Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs). However, this field grapples with ambiguities in defining temporal questions and lacks a systematic categorization of existing TKGQA methods. Motivated by this, this paper presents a thorough survey from two perspectives: the taxonomy of temporal questions and the categorization of TKGQA methodologies. Specifically, we first propose a detailed taxonomy of temporal questions explored in prior studies. Subsequently, we provide an in-depth review of TKGQA methodologies of two categories: semantic parsing-based and TKG embedding-based. We explicate advanced solutions as well as techniques used when answering temporal questions. Then, we discuss the potential impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on TKGQA. Building on the above review, we highlight potential research directions for TKGQA. This work aims to serve as a comprehensive reference for TKGQA and to inspire further research in this area.
